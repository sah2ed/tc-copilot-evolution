# Copilot Evolution Project

## Introduction
This ideation challenge is part of a project code-named: copilot evolution. 

Topcoder wants to evolve the role of copilots within the Topcoder community into a much more traditional role, similar to a salaried job. Their thesis is that, by standardizing the copilot role, they'll be able to advertise and hire people to work as copilots, like any other job opening. 

There are several assumptions baked into this thesis that will lead to problems if not properly addressed, which is why we are turning to the broader Topcoder community for help. To properly understand what this evolution project is about, it is important to review what role copilots currently play at Topcoder, and contrast it with what is obtainable in the technology industry.

## Background
The role that is currently referred to as a "copilot" within the Topcoder community, is roughly equivalent to the "technical lead" or "tech lead" (or sometimes "dev lead") designation used in the technology industry.

### What exactly is a technical lead?
[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), a job site with over 250 million unique visitors every month, defines [1] a technical lead as:

> A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases.

> A technical lead needs to have a great deal of professional experience in software development and a deep understanding of technology, but they should also be personable and capable enough to effectively lead a team and collaborate with others.
