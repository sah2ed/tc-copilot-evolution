# Copilot Evolution Project
This ideation challenge is part of a project code-named: copilot evolution. 

## Challenge Summary
Topcoder wants to evolve the role of copilots from its current form with fixed payments and no growth path, into a role with flexible payments and multiple growth paths. A copilot who acquired additional skills or displays capacity to assume additional responsibilities, deserves to be rewarded accordingly, with a role and compensation that is commensurate with their contributions to the platform. 

Although the evolution will make the role of copilots within the Topcoder community bear a lot of similarities to more conventional roles (i.e. salaried positions), there will be a number of differences, due to how software is built and delivered using the Topcoder platform. There is the expectation that at the end of the evolution effort, Topcoder will be able to advertise and hire people to work as copilots, using a conventional job opening. 


## Challenge Objective
In this challenge, we'd like you to generate ideas and prepare a proposal that can be used to evolve the copilot role using a skill-based framework.


~Topcoder wants to evolve the role of copilots within the Topcoder community into a much more traditional role, similar to a salaried job. Their thesis is that, by standardizing the copilot role, they'll be able to advertise and hire people to work as copilots, like any other job opening.~

There are several assumptions baked into this thesis that will lead to problems if not properly addressed, which is why we are turning to the broader Topcoder community for help. To properly understand what this evolution project is about, it is important to review what role copilots currently play at Topcoder, and contrast it with what is obtainable in the technology industry.

## Background
The role that is currently referred to as a "copilot" within the Topcoder community, is roughly equivalent to the "technical lead" or "tech lead" (or sometimes "dev lead") designation used in the technology industry.

### What is a tech lead?
[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), a job site with over 250 million unique visitors every month, defines [1] a technical lead as:

> A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases.

> A technical lead needs to have a great deal of professional experience in software development and a deep understanding of technology, but they should also be personable and capable enough to effectively lead a team and collaborate with others.

Now that we have an idea of what a tech lead is, we need to situate their role in the context of an organization with several employees. In other words, even though tech leads often work with developers, they usually have to collaborate with other roles like engineering managers, project managers etc.

### Where does a tech lead function?
The [Engineering Ladders](http://www.engineeringladders.com/) website, which is open source and maintained on GitHub by [@jorgef/engineeringladders](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders), contains a framework that will help us properly contextualize the role of a tech lead in a large organization. They introduce the concept of a [career ladder](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders/blob/539288966a16019f894b05b024db2ab6eaa310fe/README.md#career-ladders) consisting of four (4) rungs:

* _Developer: role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise_
* _Tech Lead: role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support_
* _Technical Program Manager: role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that expand multiple teams_
* _Engineering Manager: role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team_

### What separates a tech lead from an engineering manager?
In small organizations, the same person might perform the role of a tech lead and engineering manager, but this is often impractical in large organizations like Topcoder. 
They offer the following explanation that clearly distinguishes a tech lead from an engineering manager in large organizations [2]:

_It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the System while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the People._

Now that we understand that tech leads focus more on technology than people, while engineering managers focus more on people than technology, let's turn our sights to the Topcoder community and the role of tech leads within it.

### How do Topcoder tech leads differ from the norm?
To properly understand the role of tech leads within the Topcoder community, let's quickly go on a detour of the Topcoder platform, which the community is built upon.

### Topcoder Platform
Topcoder was founded in 2001 by Jack Hughes and it was premised on a fairly simple idea: the design, development and delivery of (complex) software "through online tournaments" [3]. The only repeatable way for Topcoder to deliver on this promise of using tournaments to develop software is by cultivating a _diverse_ community around their business. 

In other words, one of the factors that makes a tournament interesting is that it is a huge magnet for drawing in a diverse set of participants. People take part in tournaments not just for the prize money alone, they compete because tournaments afford them the opportunity to benchmark their skills against other people that are:
- less skilled than they are or;
- about as skilled as they are or; 
- more skilled than they are. 

Tournaments afford participants (and its organizers) access to a diverse pool of fellow participants, colloquially referred to as "the crowd". 
"Crowds" that exhibit this trait i.e. the relative differences between competing individuals is very uneven, are hard to recreate in a traditional workplace. 

Although this model of using "crowds" to accomplish challenging tasks is now what is widely known as "crowd-sourcing" today, the underlying concept has been studied extensively by economists, starting with a 1981 paper titled: [Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts](http://faculty.smu.edu/Millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/lazear%20rosen%201981.pdf). It is known as [Tournament theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_theory) in personnel economics and below is an excerpt from its Wikipedia entry: 

> Tournament theory is the theory in personnel economics used to describe certain situations where wage differences are based not on marginal productivity but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.

The Wikipedia entry offers us [pros and cons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_theory#Pros_and_Cons_of_Workplace_Tournaments) that we will examine in detail:

#### Pro: Incentivizing Performance
Tournaments can be very powerful at incentivising performance. Empirical research in economics and managements have shown that tournament-like incentive structure increases the individual performance or workers and managers in the workplace.

#### Pro: Matching workers and jobs
Tournaments play an important function in matching workers with jobs that are relevant/appropriate. The theoretical prediction in the literature is that higher-skilled individuals would be sorted into jobs that offer higher potential returns.

#### Con: Inequalities in the workplace
Tournaments have the potential to create large inequalities in payoffs. Incentive based tournaments are organised in such a way that some winners are created at the expense of many losers. Thus, by design there are likely to be high inequalities in payoffs in the workplace under a tournament structure. 

#### Con: Selfish and Unethical Behaviour
A major issue with tournaments is that individuals are incentivised to view others as competitors, thus encouraging selfish behaviour. This means that participants in a tournament structured workplace would be less likely to help each other and are discourage from knowledge sharing more so than in other incentive schemes. Further, tournaments may also encourage unethical behaviour in participants such as cheating or collusion in competitive sports or plagiarism in the academic field.
