# Copilot Evolution Project

## Introduction
This ideation challenge is part of a project code-named: copilot evolution. 

Topcoder wants to evolve the role of copilots within the Topcoder community into a much more traditional role, similar to a salaried job. Their thesis is that, by standardizing the copilot role, they'll be able to advertise and hire people to work as copilots, like any other job opening. 

There are several assumptions baked into this thesis that will lead to problems if not properly addressed, which is why we are turning to the broader Topcoder community for help. To properly understand what this evolution project is about, it is important to review what role copilots currently play at Topcoder, and contrast it with what is obtainable in the technology industry.

## Background
The role that is currently referred to as a "copilot" within the Topcoder community, is roughly equivalent to the "technical lead" or "tech lead" (or sometimes "dev lead") designation used in the technology industry.

### What is a tech lead?
[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), a job site with over 250 million unique visitors every month, defines [1] a technical lead as:

> A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases.

> A technical lead needs to have a great deal of professional experience in software development and a deep understanding of technology, but they should also be personable and capable enough to effectively lead a team and collaborate with others.

Now that we have an idea of what a tech lead is, we need to situate their role in the context of an organization with several employees. In other words, even though tech leads often work with developers, they usually have to collaborate with other roles like engineering managers, project managers etc.

### Where does a tech lead function?
The [Engineering Ladders](http://www.engineeringladders.com/) website, which is open source and maintained on GitHub by [@jorgef/engineeringladders](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders), contains a framework that will help us properly contextualize the role of a tech lead in a large organization. They introduce the concept of a [career ladder](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders/blob/539288966a16019f894b05b024db2ab6eaa310fe/README.md#career-ladders) consisting of four (4) rungs:

* _Developer: role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise_
* _Tech Lead: role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support_
* _Technical Program Manager: role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that expand multiple teams_
* _Engineering Manager: role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team_

### What separates a tech lead from an engineering manager?
In small organizations, the same person might perform the role of a tech lead and engineering manager, but this is often impractical in large organizations. 
They offer the following distinction between a tech lead from an engineering manager in large organizations [2]:

_It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the System while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the People._
