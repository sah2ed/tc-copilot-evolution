# Copilot Evolution Project

## Introduction
This ideation challenge is part of a project code-named: copilot evolution. 

Topcoder wants to evolve the role of copilots within the Topcoder community into a much more traditional role, similar to a salaried job. Their thesis is that, by standardizing the copilot role, they'll be able to advertise and hire people to work as copilots, like any other job opening. 

There are several assumptions baked into this thesis that will lead to problems if not properly addressed, which is why we are turning to the broader Topcoder community for help. To properly understand what this evolution project is about, it is important to review what role copilots currently play at Topcoder, and contrast it with what is obtainable in the technology industry.

## Background
The role that is currently referred to as a "copilot" within the Topcoder community, is roughly equivalent to the "technical lead" or "tech lead" (or sometimes "dev lead") designation used in the technology industry.

### What is a tech lead?
[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), a job site with over 250 million unique visitors every month, defines [1] a technical lead as:

> A technical lead is a professional who oversees a team of technical personnel at a software or technology company. They often lead software development or software engineering teams and troubleshoot technical issues that involve software development, engineering tasks and product releases.

> A technical lead needs to have a great deal of professional experience in software development and a deep understanding of technology, but they should also be personable and capable enough to effectively lead a team and collaborate with others.

Now that we have an idea of what a tech lead is, we need to situate their role in the context of an organization with several employees. In other words, even though tech leads often work with developers, they usually have to collaborate with other roles like engineering managers, project managers etc.

### Where does a tech lead function?
The [Engineering Ladders](http://www.engineeringladders.com/) website, which is open source and maintained on GitHub by [@jorgef/engineeringladders](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders), contains a framework that will help us properly contextualize the role of a tech lead in a large organization. They introduce the concept of a [career ladder](https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders/blob/539288966a16019f894b05b024db2ab6eaa310fe/README.md#career-ladders) consisting of four (4) rungs:

* _Developer: role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise_
* _Tech Lead: role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support_
* _Technical Program Manager: role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that expand multiple teams_
* _Engineering Manager: role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team_

### What separates a tech lead from an engineering manager?
In small organizations, the same person might perform the role of a tech lead and engineering manager, but this is often impractical in large organizations like Topcoder. 
They offer the following explanation that clearly distinguishes a tech lead from an engineering manager in large organizations [2]:

_It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the System while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the People._

Now that we understand that tech leads focus more on technology than people, while engineering managers focus more on people than technology, let's turn our sights to the Topcoder community and the role of tech leads within it.

### How do Topcoder tech leads differ from the norm?
To properly understand the role of tech leads within the Topcoder community, let's quickly go on a detour of the Topcoder platform which the community is built upon.

### Topcoder Platform
Topcoder was founded in 2001 by Jack Hughes and it was premised on a fairly simple idea: the design, development and delivery of (complex) software "through online tournaments" [3]. The only repeatable way for Topcoder to deliver on this promise of using tournaments to develop software is by cultivating a _diverse_ community around their business. 

In other words, one of the factors that makes a tournament interesting is that it is a huge magnet for drawing in a diverse set of participants. People take part in tournaments not just for the prize money alone, they compete because tournaments afford them the opportunity to benchmark their skills against other people that are:
- less skilled than they are or;
- about as skilled as they are or; 
- more skilled than they are. 

Tournaments afford participants (and its organizers) access to a diverse pool of fellow participants, colloquially referred to as "the crowd". 
"Crowds" that exhibit this trait i.e. the relative differences between competing individuals is very uneven, are hard to recreate in a traditional workplace. Although this model of using "crowds" to accomplish challenging tasks is now what is widely known as "crowd-sourcing", the underlying concept has been studied extensively by economists, starting with a 1981 paper titled: [Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts]()  and is called [Tournament theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_theory) in personnel economics. 


Tournament theory is the theory in personnel economics used to describe certain situations where wage differences are based not on marginal productivity but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.

In the literature of personnel economics, wage differences are based not on marginal productivity but instead upon relative differences between the individuals.
this .

If you compare tournament participants with respect to skill sets, some participants will be evenly matched, while some participants will be unevenly matched.


Stated differently realized that employees are often homogenous 

for Topcoder depends on its community  on the crowd for the development of software crowdsourcing-based business model, in which software is developed 
, is presented. 

The case highlights how TopCoder has created a unique two-sided innovation platform consisting of a global community of over 225,0000 developers who compete to write software modules for its over 40 clients Provides details of a unique innovation platform where complex software is developed through ongoing online competitions. By outlining the company's evolution, the challenges of building a community and refining a web-based competition platform are illustrated. Experiences and perspectives from TopCoder community members and clients help show what it means to work from within or in cooperation with an online community. In the case, the use of distributed innovation and its potential merits as a corporate problem solving mechanism is discussed. Issues related to TopCoder's scalability, profitability and growth are also explored.
